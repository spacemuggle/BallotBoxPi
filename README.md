# BallotBoxPi
Project to turn raspberry pi into a laser trip sensor that plays a random sound when the laser is tripped. This is intended as use on the inside of a ballot box so sound is played when a ballot is dropped in.

## Goals:

- [ ] Auto detect flash-drive and get audio files (.mp3 & .wav) and volume from a volume.txt file.
- [ ] Create script to calibrate and montitor laser sensors for "trip".
- [ ] Write function that plays a random sound asynchronously.
- [ ] Determine method for attaching bluetooth speakers without screen.
- [ ] Add shutdown button.

## Notes

* VLC Player worked briefly and now fails
* Trying mpg321 on fresh install next
